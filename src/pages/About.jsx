          My name is Sara but I go by Seven. I am currently a student at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte and I am studying Full Stack Web Developement. It felt like something was missing from my life and after some deep thinking,I decided it was time to make a change and left my career of 15 years to perue my passion. I am now a proud Full Stack Web Developer with an extensive background in design, the financial industry and corporate acumen.
